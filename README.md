# Classification of Iris Flowers
Internship Projects in Data Science:
This specific machine learning project is commonly known as the introductory "Hello World" example in the field. The dataset used for classifying iris flowers consists of numerical attributes, making it an ideal starting point for beginners to understand supervised machine learning algorithms and gain knowledge in handling and loading data. Additionally, due to its small size, this dataset can be easily accommodated in memory without the need for complex transformations or scaling operations.
